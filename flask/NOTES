Asynchronous actions:

AJAX request comes from client.  Initiates action on server.

Client has logic to repeatedly query status, where the status reply
include what action is ongoing, or the last action and a final status
on its failure or completion.

The failure modes are that the client may not get the request into the
server, in which case it will eventually get a status response indicating
that nothing was done.

Or the server may not be able to get a reply back - in which case the
client will spin for a while, and eventually when a response comes back
it will be apparent that the original request either succeeded or
failed.
